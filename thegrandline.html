                  GUYS I ACTUALLY FOUND SOMETHING!!! I was exploring the ruins
                  of the Old Museum like the rumors said and I found part of a
                  ticket behind that third painting! It only has partial numbers
                  but it starts with "XRB". I'm going to keep searching for the
                  rest. Has anyone else found fragments that might match?

                    Are you sure it's real? I've heard The Collectors plant fake

                    You can't just go around accusing people of murder without

                    ever been charged? Where is this "evidence" you speak about

                    Here we go again with another Grand Line apologist trying

                    something - have YOU seen any of these so-called murders
                    reported on mainstream media outlets? No, because they don't
                    exist! It’s all just a smear campaign perpetuated by those

                    I know what you are trying to do here. You want me believe
                    that there is some grand conspiracy against John going on
                    behind closed doors, but how can anyone possibly prove
                    something like this without any hard evidence? All we have
                    right now is speculation and hearsay—two things which should
                    never be used when making serious accusations about
                    someone's character or involvement in criminal activity...

                    will come out eventually, whether it’s through leaked

                    whistleblowers speaking up against the corrupt system they
                    helped maintain for so long—or even better yet; when John
                    himself decides that his time atop this rotten empire has
                    finally run its course... Then everyone will see just how
                    much blood stains littered throughout history he left behind

                  website? I converted it and it says "The first letter of each
                  paragraph" - so I checked each paragraph and got "TFTIWI"
                  which doesn't make sense. Am I missing something? Could this
                  be related to the ticket cipher?
